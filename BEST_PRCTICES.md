# Best Practices

The file name should be descriptive of the file or the purpose of the file. The same comes to the folder names.

## Rules

1. File names should be descriptive.
2. Do not use spaces. Instead use:

  - dashes: file-name.doc (preferred for search engines)
  - underscores: file_name.doc
  - camel case: FileName.doc (**Note:** Uppercase is allowed only in the particular cases like React components, etc.)
  - upper case: FILENAME.dm (**Note:** Using all UpperCase is only recommended for documentation purposes using markdown syntax)

3. Special characters should be avoided: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; < > ? , [ ] { } ‘ “

4. Use only 1 dot per filename as it belongs just prior to the file extension

*Example:*
- `manage.py`
- `README.md`
- `requirements.txt`


5. Make name as descriptive as possible and as short as possible.

6. If sequential numbering is required, use it in a proper format.

*Example:*
- `sample-001.csv`
- `sample-002.csv`
- `sample-003.csv`


## Things to keep in mind

When naming your files/folders consider the following:

1. Purpose of the file/folder
2. Location of the file/folder
3. Project architecture
4. Date
5. Type of data
6. Readability
